    <h1>Submitting a Feature Request in Rhythmic and Jira</h1>
    <p>To submit a feature request within Dell, follow the steps below to move from idea generation in Rhythmic to implementation in Jira. This ensures requests are organized, actionable, and tracked effectively.</p>

    <h2>1. Start in Rhythmic</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create a New Idea</strong>: In Rhythmic, navigate to the Ideas section and create a new entry. Give it a descriptive title that clearly identifies the feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Detail the Feature</strong>: Add a specific description, acting as an “elevator pitch.” Explain what the feature is, why it’s needed, and how it aligns with current objectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Justify the Need</strong>: Provide a brief business case or outline pain points addressed by the feature. Include any relevant user stories, scenarios, or use cases to illustrate its value.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Priority and Impact</strong>: Use Rhythmic’s priority settings to mark the feature as essential, important, or nice-to-have. If applicable, add projected impact details for users or workflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Move the Idea to Your Team’s Backlog</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transition to Jira</strong>: Once the idea is fleshed out and approved as a priority, create a feature request in Jira. Link the Rhythmic idea to the Jira ticket to maintain traceability.</li>
        <li><strong>Refine with Details</strong>: In Jira, expand on the feature with technical specifications or requirements as needed. Assign the ticket to the appropriate sprint or backlog based on your team’s planning process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Communicate & Collaborate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Engage During Sprint Planning</strong>: Discuss the new feature during sprint planning or refinement sessions. Use this time to clarify requirements, gather feedback, and make adjustments.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow Up & Track Progress</strong>: Monitor the Jira ticket’s status. Rhythmic allows for automatic updates on the idea’s progression, so you’ll stay informed as development proceeds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Stay Involved</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide Additional Context</strong>: During development, be prepared to answer questions or provide further clarification as needed. This helps ensure that the feature aligns closely with your original vision.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">This workflow ensures that your feature requests are organized, detailed, and actionable, leading to a smoother transition from idea generation in Rhythmic to implementation in Jira.</p>
